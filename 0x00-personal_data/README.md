# Personal Data Backend with Authentication

This project provides a secure backend system for handling personal data with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. It is designed to comply with data privacy standards and can serve as the foundation for applications requiring user profile management, login functionality, and secure data storage.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 Secure authentication using JWT or session-based tokens
* 🧾 CRUD operations for user personal data
* 🧠 Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
* 🛡️ Middleware for protected routes
* ✅ Input validation and sanitization
* 🧩 Role-based access control (optional)
* 📦 RESTful API endpoints

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Backend Framework**: Node.js (Express) / Python (Flask or Django) / other
* **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth / Sessions
* **ORM**: Mongoose / Sequelize / SQLAlchemy
* **Environment Management**: dotenv

## 📌 API Endpoints

### Auth Routes

| Method | Endpoint       | Description              |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| POST   | /auth/register | Register a new user      |
| POST   | /auth/login    | Login and receive token  |
| POST   | /auth/logout   | Logout user              |
| GET    | /auth/me       | Get current user profile |

### User Data Routes

| Method | Endpoint   | Description             |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | /user/\:id | Get personal data by ID |
| PUT    | /user/\:id | Update personal data    |
| DELETE | /user/\:id | Delete user account     |

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-data-backend.git
   cd personal-data-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   DB_URI=your_database_connection
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   python app.py
   ```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* All passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms.
* Sensitive data is never stored in plain text.
* Token-based authentication ensures stateless, scalable sessions.
* Input is sanitized to prevent SQL injection or XSS.
